#### Group members: Sara Salim, Nasra Diriye & Angelina Vasileva

In this project, we created a web application for food bloggers, enthusiasts, and practically anyone looking for inspiration in the kitchen. The platform allows users to browse and share a variety of recipes, making it an interactive space for culinary exploration. Registered users can also publish their own recipes, leave reviews and even save their favorite recipes.

## Key features:
- **User authentication:** Users can safely sign up, log in, and manage their profile information. In the case of a forgotten password, users can retrieve their account by entering their email and receiving a secure link to create a new password.

- **Favorites collections:** Users can save their favorite recipes for easy access and manage their favorites list.
- **Admin controls:** Admin users have additional privileges, such as managing user accounts and recipes.

This application allows food lovers to share a mutual space, as they explore new recipes, share their culinary creations, and discover diverse cooking styles from around the world. Whether it's an experienced chef or a beginner in the kitchen, this platform makes it easy to find inspiration and engage with a community of like-minded individuals. The application is currently in Finnish, but it is a work in progress to expand the language options and make it more accessible to users worldwide.
